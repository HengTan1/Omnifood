# Omnifood Personal Project
Included Programs: HTML, CSS and basic JavaScript

This project idea was given by a professor. This was a mock webpage project. I was given all the content required to accomplish the given webpage and the layout corresponding to it. It includes the trials and errors of my process of learning basic JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 

My idea for a personal project came from wanting to improve my portfolio. I asked a professor at my recently graduated University of North Carolina at Greensboro to give me a project to replicate the real world job and atmosphere of the project. I built it in a timely manner while learning HTML and CSS mainly with some very basic JavaScript. I was given criticism to make minor improvements and optimization. Some optimization was learning how to make the webpage responsive on all devices and learn to use the most optimal way of coding in the real world such as using rem as the overall units.

The pictures uploaded into the file will be of all the required pages that was created. I will provide screenshots of both the full desktop version and the mobile version to show the responsiveness of the webpage.
