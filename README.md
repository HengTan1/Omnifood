# Omnifood Personal Project
This project includes programs such as HTML, CSS and basic JavaScript
This project idea was given by a professor. This was a mock webpage project. I was given all the content required to accomplish the given webpage and the layout corresponding to it. 
It includes the trials and errors of my process of learning basic JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 
My idea for a personal project came from wanting to improve my portfolio. I asked a professor at my recently graduated University of North Carolina at Greensboro to give me a project to replicate the real world job and atmosphere of the project. I built it in a timely manner while learning HTML and CSS mainly with some very basic JavaScript. I was given criticism to make minor improvements and optimization. 
Below are the screenshots links of the webpage of each individual section:
